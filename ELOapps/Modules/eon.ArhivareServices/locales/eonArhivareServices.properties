 Here you can define all text you need in your module. This text can be
 localized in new properties files by creating a copy of this file
 with the language postfix (e.g. myModule.properties -> myModule_<lang>.properties,
 where <lang> is the two letter ISO 639 language e.g. <lang> = fr).
 The file must be stored as UTF-8.
